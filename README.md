```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Games-Time.git
cd Games-Time
```

### Python  
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  

Install dependencies (if needed):  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Java  
Make sure you have JDK installed. Compile with:  
```bash
javac rock_paper_scissor_gme.java
java rock_paper_scissor_gme
```
---

## 🕹️ Usage  

Run any game individually:  

**Python Example:**  
```bash
python snake.py
```

**Java Example:**  
```bash
java rock_paper_scissor_gme
```

---

## ✨ Features  
- Multiple games in one repository.  
- Written in both **Python** and **Java**.  
- Beginner-friendly code.  
- Great for learning logic, OOP, and event handling.  

---

## 📦 Dependencies  

Most Python games rely on **pygame**. Install it with:  
```bash
pip install pygame
```

Other games may only use built-in libraries like `random` or `sys`.  

---

## 🔧 Configuration  
Each game is standalone. No global configuration is required.  

---

## 🎮 Examples  
- Launch **Snake** and try to beat your high score.  
- Play **Tic Tac Toe** with a friend.  
- Challenge yourself with **Breakout** or **Flappy Bird**.  
---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting  
- **Game won’t start?** Ensure Python 3 and pygame are installed.  
- **Java program not compiling?** Check your JDK installation.  
- **Graphics not rendering?** Some games may require a display environment (not headless).
